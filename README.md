# Multi-Robot-Maze-Solving
## Autonomous robots navigation within an unknown environment

Autonomous movement within an unknown area and complex environment like mazes requires the robots to carry out investigations and Maze solving plays an imperative role in the area of robotics and in the
development of optimal algorithms for autonomous robots to explore and navigate. It can be challenging for navigating multiple robots deployed in an unknown environment filled with obstacles .This project aims at
finding the shortest path for each autonomous robot to reach its destination in an environment, for the robots to move towards their goal. These robots have to move safely ensuring collision freeness and liveness. We sense the nearby surroundings and apply A* search to find an optimal path to the goal state of the robot.
